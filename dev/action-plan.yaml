    - name: "Mirador Core API changes"
      probability: "medium"
      impact: "high" 
      mitigation: "Regular API compatibility checks"
      trigger: "Contract tests fail or Mirador release notes flag breaking changes"
      contingency: "Pair with Mirador team to patch client within one sprint and update mappings"
    - name: "Grafana plugin API deprecation"
      probability: "low"
      impact: "medium"
      mitigation: "Follow Grafana release notes closely"
