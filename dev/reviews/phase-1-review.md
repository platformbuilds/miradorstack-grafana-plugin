# Phase 1 Review – Foundation Setup

_Date: 2025-09-26_

## Achievements
- App (`app/`) and data source (`datasource/`) plugins scaffolded via Grafana create-plugin tool and reorganized within monorepo.
- Local development workflow documented (`dev/setup.md`, root `docker-compose.yaml`) and validated with `npm run build` / `npm run dev`.
- Mirador-specific TypeScript contracts defined in `datasource/src/types.ts`, including query defaults, schema models, and UI state placeholders.
- UX baseline notes and accessibility palette captured in `dev/design/baselines.md`; testing strategy codified in `dev/testing/strategy.md`.
- Datasource configuration UI updated to support Mirador URL, tenant, WebSocket toggle, and secure bearer token storage.
- Mirador API client scaffolded (`datasource/src/api/MiradorAPIClient.ts`) with typed endpoints, auth headers, and timeout handling.
- Backend stub enhanced (`datasource/pkg/plugin`) to parse new query shape, validate config, and return representative frames for logs/metrics/traces.
- Initial unit test harness in place for datasource UI and API client plus backend unit tests; Jest/Go test suites passing.

## Open Risks & Follow-ups
- Mirador API client currently unused by datasource; integration with real Mirador endpoints planned for Phase 2 alongside contract tests.
- Backend responses return stub data; replace with real Mirador calls once connectivity available.
- Need to wire “Test connection” UI affordance to surface backend health results within configuration page.

## Sign-off
- ✅ Architecture & Implementation: aarvee11
- ✅ UX: aarvee11
- ✅ QA: aarvee11

Decision: Proceed to Phase 2 – Core Data Access.
