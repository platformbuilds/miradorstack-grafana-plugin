# Phase 2 Review – Core Data Access

## Summary
Phase 2 connected the Grafana datasource to live Mirador Core APIs across logs, metrics, and traces. The Lucene builder now powers both logs and trace queries with inline validation, while PromQL queries execute end to end for metrics. Opt-in WebSocket streaming keeps log panels live without refreshing.

## Highlights
- Lucene builder + raw editor toggle in `datasource/src/components/QueryEditor.tsx`
- Query parse/validate/build helpers covered by `datasource/src/utils/__tests__/lucene.test.ts`
- Mirador API client hardened with timeout + error handling (`datasource/src/api/MiradorAPIClient.ts`)
- Backend `QueryData` path fans out to logs, metrics, traces using typed client wrappers
- Live log streaming implemented via `datasource/src/live/MiradorLiveStream.ts`

## Test Evidence
- `npm run test:ci --prefix datasource` passes with new suites for lucene utils, API client, live stream
- `GO111MODULE=on go test ./...` under `datasource/` covers query + health flows
- `dev/tests/smoke.sh` orchestrates Jest + Go integration checks and is referenced in setup docs

## Risks / Follow-ups
- Staging smoke workflow still pending until Mirador staging credentials land
- PromQL ↔ Lucene translation remains future work (tracked for advanced UX phase)
- Need to capture tenant-specific field catalogs to improve builder suggestions

## Approval
- ✅ Data access requirements met for logs, metrics, traces
- ✅ Test coverage in place for critical paths
- Next: Kick off Phase 3 focusing on Discover UI
