# Phase 3 Review Summary

_Date: 2025-02-19_
_Attendees:_ aarvee11 (Architect), Jamie Patel, Taylor Chen, Morgan Lee, Riley Gomez, Samir Khan

## Highlights
- Discover shell, histogram, field sidebar, and document table are feature-complete with Mirador fixtures.
- Field stats overlay extends quick-insight workflows and funnels into filter creation.
- Saved filter groups persist via local storage and advanced filters drawer supports CRUD operations.
- Jest + Playwright + Go suites are green; new visual harness documented for CI integration.

## Decisions
- Proceed to Phase 4 (schema integration) without blocking issues.
- Carry medium-severity UX backlog items (see `dev/design/issues-phase3.md`) into the next planning cycle.
- Defer Chromatic CI wiring until the Grafana CI runner upgrade lands (target: Week 8).

## Risks / Follow-ups
- Need better feedback when saved filters fail (tracked as UX-39).
- Histogram accessibility improvements required before public beta (UX-37).
- Performance metrics for virtual scrolling remain anecdotal; add profiling scenario in Phase 4.

## Sign-off
âœ… The steering group approves moving to Phase 4.
