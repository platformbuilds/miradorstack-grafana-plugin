# Testing Work Items – Phase 2

## Immediate
- [x] Contract fixtures for Mirador logs/metrics/traces queries (Jest + Go integration coverage)
- [ ] Smoke test workflow hitting Mirador staging (nightly) once connectivity available — pending staging credentials
- [x] Backend Go integration tests for Mirador API client once proxy layer added

## Stretch
- [ ] End-to-end Playwright scenario: configure datasource, run logs query, visualize results
- [ ] Performance smoke test to confirm pagination + virtual scroll thresholds
